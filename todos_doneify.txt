unsure about whether it works: 
  when alarm rings for the last time, delete it from active alarms
  change active alarms when task is checked through kotlin alarm

snooze isn't working
alter alarm time for past alarms when the device reboots: don't add unecessary things in intent(those details might vary from the ones store in active alarms, this will be a problem while deletion), in alarm receiver fetch those details from active alarms, when repeating alarm is fired update time in active alarms
method channel can't be used after reboot(task checked won't work)

beautify the alarm UI

remove unecessary stuff for getIt registration
