unsure about whether it works: 
  repeating alarms
  when alarm rings for the last time, delete it from active alarms

check whether future time really works for every year tasks
alarms shouldn't ring if the task is checked

alarms should be set again on reboot
beautify the alarm UI

remove unecessary stuff for getIt registration
